## Recipe Web Service

Recipe Web Service is specifically designed to manage recipes. It allows adding, updating, removing and fetching recipes and ingredients from database and render the requested details as JSON response to end user. It also has the search capability with helps to search recipes based on any filter criteria.The response from ReST APIs can be further integrated with front end view for better presentation.

## System Design

Recipe Web Service is microservice based layered architecture with RESTful Web Service. There are 4 layers from top to bottom:

- API Layer\
Top layer, which is main interface available for front-end or end user to consume APIs
Contains end points implementation
Springboot-starter-web module used as a framework to implement ReSTful api end points

- Service Layer\
The service layer is a layer in an application that facilitates communication between the api end point and the data access layer. Additionally, business logic is stored in the service layer.
It is responsible for interacting with Data Access Layer and transferring the recipes data as required by top and below layers
Further it is a module added to decouple business logic of recipes data transfer and mapping from/to API layer

- Data Access Layer\
The persistence layer contains all the database storage logic. It is responsible for converting business objects to the database row and vice-versa with Object Relationship Mapping (ORM).
This layer contains recipe entity classes and JPA repositories which implement lower level functionality of storing/retrieving recipes data

- Persistence Layer\
Bottom most layer, responsible for physically storing the recipes data onto database table.
Table - recipes,ingredients,recipe_ingredient are used to store the recipes data for the service
For development and testing purposes, the Embedded H2 Database provided by Spring Boot framework is also utilized

#### Minimum Requirements

- Java 11
- Maven 3.x
- Git 

### Steps to build Web Service

1. Download zip from https://github.com/jkolay/recipe.git
2. Move to recipe and follow Install application command line in recipe folder
3. Build project

  ```
  $ mvn clean package 
  ```
  To build by skipping unit tests run maven command 
 ```
  $ mvn clean package -DskipTests= true
  ```


On successfull build completion, one should have web service jar in target directory named as
```
recipe-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Command to execute:

  ```
  $ java -jar recipe-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  ```
